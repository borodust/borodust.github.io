title: cl-bodge documentation efforts has begun

It started, at last!

I have so much going on in CL land that writing a documentation for a thing no one uses (besides
me, obviously) and is not even stable enough, is literally one of the last things I consider
doing. But lately there was some interest in [trivial-gamekit]({% link
projects/trivial-gamekit.md %}) internals[^1] which is really just a high-level `cl-bodge`
interface, so I finally decided to bring my ass into writing at least some documentation for
most stable parts of it. Refreshed [introductory]({% link projects/cl-bodge.md %}) and an
[overview]({% link projects/cl-bodge/overview.md %}) pages so far.

Hopefully, that wouldn't be the end of it - the immense effort generic programmers like myself
 very love to engage with.
