In the past there were a couple of requests to write about my experiences with various tools. Sometimes I just had something to say on a particular topic. Therefore, I finally decided to organize a place to share my thoughts and whatever knowledge I had acquired no one else probably cares about.

And here we are now. Welcome to boroblog! Place where I can polish my english writing skills at the expense of readers curiousity.
