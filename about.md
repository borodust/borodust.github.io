<img src="{%link public/decent_face.jpg %}" class="intro-face-photo">I'm a professional [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) software developer who prefers [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp) for side-projects. You can contact me through various social media resources listed on the sidebar on the right or via IRC in `#lispgames` or `#lisp` at `chat.freenode.net`.

At this very moment I'm working on a game engine called [cl-bodge](https://github.com/borodust/cl-bodge). Join us at [`#lispgames`](http://lispgames.org) to dive into secret alien technology of making games with Lisp!
