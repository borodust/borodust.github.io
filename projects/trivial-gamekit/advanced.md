## Continuous Integration and Deployment

### Introduction

Services like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and [AppVeyor](https://appveyor.com/) allow us
to apply continuous integration practices to Common Lisp software across 3 major platforms:
`Windows` (AppVeyor), `GNU/Linux` and `macOS` (Travis CI). Not only pure CI, but it is also
possible to deploy built software to several providers including [GitHub](https://github.com/)
releases. `trivial-gamekit` is shaped with CI and cross-platform building in mind. Lets see what
has to be done to use those tools.
